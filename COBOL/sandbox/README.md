### Summary

* This is not a serious venture!
* With the demand for COBOL during the pandemic, I thought it would be interesting to "kick the tires" a bit. (I took one semester of COBOL, centuries ago).

### Notes

* using [1], download image from docker: `docker pull gregcoleman/docker-cobol`
* edit folder in `run.sh` as appropriate 
* to use image: `run.sh`
* at prompt in image, to compile: `cobc first_cobol_hello.cbl` (from [2])
* at prompt in image, to run: `./hello`

### Goal

A minimal, sandbox project that illustrates the interoperability between Java and Kotlin.

### TODOs

* TODO: a small program in Java that calls a Kotlin class, `Animal`. An animal should make a sound based on an input parameter (e.g. 1 == 'Meow', 2 == 'Woof', etc).
* TODO: a small program in Kotlin that calls a Java class, `Vehicle`. A vehicle should use a fuel based on an input paramter (e.g. 1 == 'Electric', 2 == 'Gasoline', etc).
* TODO: each program should have a runner Bash script which do not need to be the same.
* TODO: Use Java 21 and Kotlin 2.2.x. Assume these are installed in the Terminal with SDKMan!

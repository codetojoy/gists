### Summary

* I'm reading [this book](https://pragprog.com/titles/khrust/)
* source-code is [here](http://media.pragprog.com/titles/khrust/code/khrust-code.zip)
* specific example is `jsint_roguewasm`
    - there is a `build.sh` that has a `cargo` and `wasm-bindgen` command
    - the latter command is failing as described [here](https://forum.devtalk.com/t/programming-webassembly-with-rust-building-rogue-webassembly-game/1277)

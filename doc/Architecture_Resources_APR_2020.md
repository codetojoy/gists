### Notes

These resources are geared towards:
* Architecture of large systems for the enterprise
    - e.g. the importance of people skills and communication
    - e.g. making technology choices for long-term, large projects
* _Becoming_ an architect
    - i.e. switching roles from a senior dev to architect

Some major figures are Martin Fowler, Neal Ford, Nathaniel Schutta, and Mark Richards. They are all brilliant and excellent presenters. Though they are "thought-leaders" so sometimes they have ideas that a rather cutting edge. e.g. Martin Fowler was talking about micro-services in 2014.

I've put some video links below. I don't have any specific book recommendations, but Mark Richards mentions some books at [5]. He also has a large set of lessons at [4]. 

Alas, there's not a lot here to help with architecting a particular software project, though some of the principles might apply "in the small". For that kind of review, you might consider [6] or [7], or even PEI Devs, as there is a lot of expertise there.

### General

* Site looks good re: style. Simple and straight-ahead, which matches the philosophy.
* Needs contact info ?
* How does one give feedback on a specific article? Medium has the "clapping" which is a great idea. (Clearly, there are pros and cons with using a 3rd-party site. Probably a better conversation in person. I've been tempted by Medium, but one day it'll just be another Blogger, which seems so dated now.)  

### Specific Article on Testing

* I think the writing style and content is a good fit for the stated philosophy of the blog. 
* Perhaps mention the phases in relation to the [Dreyfus model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition). (It seems esoteric but is highly intuitive.)

### Grammar, Writing

* One suggestion: be concise. I've been slammed by editors for several things in the past, but the biggest lesson learned is to be concise. For example: 
    * _One big folly I see happening is trying to implement too many tests at once._ This is fine in conversation, but wordy when written down. 
    * It could be _Don't write too many tests at once!_
* Perhaps consider more punctuation? For example: _More commas for clauses, as in this sentence_. It's a pain, but helps the reader big-time.

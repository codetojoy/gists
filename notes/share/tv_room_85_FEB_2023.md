### Streaming a website

* use Chrome on Samsung phone to go to a web page
* swipe for apps on the phone and find "Google Home"
    - it is _not_ in the Google group of apps (!)
* in Google Home app, there should be a button for:

* the TV will show the app
* go back to the webpage in Chrome and start video
    - it can be tricky, but if you go into full screen on phone, the TV should as well

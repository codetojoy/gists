## Notes

### General

* Overall, looks so much better than the old one!
* For mobile, we may want some padding, esp. on the left margin?

### Overview page

* Layout looks great
* I think "Nerd Club" is not very common; it seems jarring for that phrase to have such prominence. Consider this: "The PEI Developers Group (aka. PEI Devs) is simply an informal group of software developers, web designers, and other techies. Some call it, colloquially, *"Nerd Club"*."
* Prefer "hack events" over "hackathons"
    - just FYI, we haven't had a hackathon in a long time, and most of us are completely burned out on them 
* Prefer "LGBTQ2S+" over "LGBT", as mentioned on call
    - reference [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/LGBTQ2S%2B)
    - I fully support the community but they need a new name
* I think the history section needs to an overhaul, eventually
    - it is from 2017-ish and doesn't reflect reality
    - e.g. Open Data Book Club and UX/UI have been defunct for years 

### Code of Conduct page

* looks great

### Elders page

* looks great

### Event history page

* I think the long CSV link looks a little odd?  
* We might include a link to the [other file](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.md) as well, as it is arguably more searchable.
* Timeline view is fabulous
* Summary of the schema for the CSV file:
    - `Venue` is defined [here](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/Venue_v2.csv)
    - `Type` is defined [here](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/Type_v2.csv)
        - `L` for Lightning Talks
        - `P` for Panel discussion
        - `` for regular meetup
    - `Type Context` lists speakers for events with `Type` of `L` or `P`
    - `A/V Support` is for those who faciliated the meetup through equipment or $
        - we used to borrow a projector from ScreenScape and wanted to credit them
* FYI, we have a special events file [here](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/SpecialEvents.csv)
    - clearly, these have dissipated in recent years

### Sponsors page

* Consider "A big "thank you!" to our current sponsors:" over "The sponsors of PEI Devs are currently:"

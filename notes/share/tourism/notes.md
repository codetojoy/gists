### Overview

Tourism is a huge industry on PEI. It is so important that it is highly regulated to ensure quality. e.g. You have to register with a gov't agency (for inspections) to run a Bed & Breakfast. The main website is [1] below (see Resources).

Quick facts: 
* population is 150k 
* The Island is fairly large: about the size of Delaware. 
* It's not realistic to tour the Island in one day. The main city is Charlottetown, population 45k.

Peak tourism season is July and especially August. There is a week in August called "Old Home Week" [5] which is roughtly the same as a "state fair" in the USA. There is a major horse/harness race called "The Gold Cup and Saucer". As you'd expect, it can be hard to get accommodations in the peak times. There is a small window for warm water/swimming at the beaches: late July and August. I think people would be looking to book cottages/hotels in March or April (with intent of staying in July/August), maybe earlier. That said, there might be more things open in 2022 because of gas prices, COVID-19, etc. 

Major attractions: 
* the beaches (esp. "the north shore" such as Cavendish). The North Shore has dunes (like Cape Cod); the south shore is more rocky. see [2]
* A musical/play called "Anne of Green Gables" (based on a book that is super popular with young girls), has been running since mid 1960s. "Anne" is an industry/culture onto itself, esp. in Cavendish (where the book is set). see [3] 
* excellent food, esp. lobster, mussels, oysters  
* camping is popular
* lots of live music, esp. traditional fiddle/Irish tunes 

Other draws:
* deep-sea fishing [4]
* an old rail-line has been converted to a bike/walking trail that spans the Island. Not sure if it is easy to rent bikes [6]
* there's a small casino and race-track for harness racing in Charlottetown 
* lots of lighthouses, and probably some with tours [7]

Not a good fit:
* though the Island has gentle hills, there's not much for adventure here. Not sure about zip lines, but there is probably jet-ski rental

Alternatives
* To be fair, do consider Cape Breton island (part of Nova Scotia) and the Magdalen Islands (part of Quebec). I'm biased towards PEI but in truth Cape Breton is prettier (esp. in the autumn) and "the Maggies" are much smaller and more quaint (though quite French).
* I'm always a bit nervous that people would come here and not really like it. FWIW, one friend from USA did like it, and said the Island countryside reminded her of Wales.
* One woman from DRA in St. Louis said that Cavendish reminded her of Branson, MO. I was horrified but saw her point. There can be a lot of kitsch in places.

### Accommodations

There's lots of options: cottages, hotels, inns, B&Bs, Air Bnb, camp sites, etc. The only issue would be availability and location. Absolute "prime" is near the North Shore in July/August. Though if you stayed in Charlottetown, Cavendish is only about 40 minutes away. In 2022, I believe rental cars are scarce.

Examples:
* [8] is on the very high-end for PEI. I don't know prices or your budget, but it would be a place to start.
* A moderate option might be a chain hotel [9] in Charlottetown. Though you'd need a rental car for the beaches. However, you could easily walk around Charlottetown to bars/restaurants.

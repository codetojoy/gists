at 0:10 in the video, I believe he plays an ornament that is essentially Dsus4 to D:

```
Dsus4 - x-x-0-2-3-3
D     - x-x-0-2-3-2

after first chord, let D, G, B strings ring out as much as possible.
this means that the barre with the index finger has to lift for the high e string:

e|-3--2--0--2---
B|-3--------3---
G|-2--------2---
D|-0--------0---
A|--------------
E|--------------

fingering ('p' means pull off):

    p 
e|-r--i--0--i---
B|-m--------m---
G|-i--------i---
D|-0--------0---
A|--------------
E|--------------
```

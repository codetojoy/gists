### Resources

* data set [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Guitar+Chords+finger+positions), esp. [chord fingers](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00575/)
    - licensing is not obvious
    - mentions [this site](https://www.fachords.com/) which I use all the time (for [this game](https://www.fachords.com/tools/fretboard-trainer/))!
    - same file (?) [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aartiravariya/chordfingerscsv) with web view
* [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3220097/12704) mentions Guitar Pro and PowerTab, which were the first formats that came to mind
    - I don't know much about them though ...  
* I found an academic paper and [this repo](https://github.com/marl/GuitarSet) that has guitar recordings in a data set

### Applications

* [this site](https://www.oolimo.com/guitarchords/find) is interesting
* [this site](https://www.all-guitar-chords.com/) is strong sauce, esp. the 1,2,3,4,5 buttons
* [this site](http://chordfind.com/) is low-rent but interesting

### Theory

* aside from open chords, players learn movable shapes. so rather than "play a G chord", we think
"what is the major chord shape, in G"
    - [this site](https://appliedguitartheory.com/lessons/caged-guitar-theory-system/) describes the CAGED system which defines shapes for familiar chords, which are movable
    - [this site](https://www.guitar-chord.org/articles/funk.html) shows some movable funk chord shapes. These are jazz/funk but often used in pop music.
* inversions are simply a permutation of the notes in a chord
    - if G major is G,B,D, then the 1st inversion is B,D,G
    - some good info [here](https://appliedguitartheory.com/lessons/learning-guitar-chord-inversions/)
* slash chords
    - e.g. C/B is a C chord with B added as a bass note
    - good info [here](https://www.guitar-chord.org/slash-chords.html)

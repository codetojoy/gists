* below are questions to consider asking a sales-rep

### questions

* what preparation needs to be done to the house?
    - e.g. roof
    - e.g. wiring, fusebox
    - are these costs in the estimate? (probably not)
* what is impact on home insurance rates?
* what is impact on home resale value?
* (obviously) how much $, per month, is expected for:
    - solar bill
    - Maritime Electric bill
* if we choose a long-term lease, what happens if we sell the house?
* what happens if Maritime Electric's power goes out?
    - can we run the home on our solar panels?
* what happens in winter?
    - what about a hail storm?
    - birds/squirrels nesting?
* which grants/rebates are available?
* what is the lead-time between signing a contract and generating solar power?

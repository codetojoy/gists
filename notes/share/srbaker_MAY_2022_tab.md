* on electric guitar with light strings (9s or 8s), try this:

```
Am - x-12-14-14-13-12
        i  r  p  m  i
```

* arpeggiate/pick each string slowly and separately to see if they ring true
    - if not, there's something wrong with technique
    - if OK, then it is probably hand strength

* if Am is OK, then move down 2 frets and repeat

```
Gm - x-10-12-12-11-10
Fm - x-8-10-10-9-8
...
Bm - x-2-4-4-3-2
```

* if you find a chord that isn't clean, then focus on that one and work until clean

* I can't play right now (donated plasma) but I doubt if I can play a Bb7 chord with clean G-string, on an acoustic:

```
Bb7 - x-1-3-1-3-1
```

* some chords are just bastards

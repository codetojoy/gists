### Summary

* Markdown viewer
* Trimmed down from the tutorial/starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).
* Markdown files are located in ~/pages/posts

### TODO

* currently the viewer doesn't handle subfolders
* `pages/api/filelist2.js` will find all Markdown files, recursively, under `~/posts`
* use `filelist2.js` in `posts.js` to list all Markdown files (recursively)

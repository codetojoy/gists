"Moonshine on the Subway: An Intro To Java 9 Modules"

Java 9 is scheduled for release in mid-September, and will contain the long-awaited module system (aka Project Jigsaw). For Java developers, modularity is a new dimension which has big implications on packaging and deployment of software. For example: "public" can have nuance; the venerable classpath receives a new, stronger teammate: the modulepath; and the JDK *itself* is modularized, with changes to runtime organization (so long, "rt.jar" !).

In this talk, we'll examine the main concepts of Java 9 modules. Note: this talk is similar to the one given at Maritime DevCon 2017, but will not cover the political drama, as the issues have been resolved. We assume the audience is at least intermediate-level with Java.
